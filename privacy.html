        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. ZenJournal does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information outside of the
          app. Your private logs will never leave your device without your explicit action and permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use the Backup function in the app, the backup file you created are currently not encrypted (we are working on it).
          Please treat the file with ultimate caution when storing and exporting, because anyone with access to the file
          can open your logs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We donâ€™t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties. We don't even have analytics, your
          feedback and reviews are the only way for the developer to understand your usage and needs of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide you with the best app experience, we may update this private policy from time to time as we make changes to the
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of ZenJournal will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information.
          If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.
